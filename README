libee was originally written to support the Mitre/CEE proposed event expression format.
However, that format has undergone several changes even before the first release,
and what libee provides has never been put into practice.

Early versions of rsyslog and liblognorm used it for representing structured content.
However, this is long gone. We do not know of any other user. So libee should be of
no further interest and is provided here solely for historical reasons.

NO FURTHER MAINTAINCE or development HAPPENS!
